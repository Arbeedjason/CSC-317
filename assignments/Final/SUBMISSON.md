### Implementation Summary
This final project was a great opportunity to bring together everything Iâ€™ve learned throughout the course. Integrating my group project into a personal portfolio helped me understand how to present collaborative work in a professional format. I also gained valuable experience deploying full-stack applications, troubleshooting deployment issues, and ensuring cross-platform functionality with GitHub Pages and Render.

### Challenges & Solutions
One of the biggest lessons I learned was how critical environment consistency is in full-stack development. I ran into deployment issues related to native modules like `bcrypt`, which taught me how to resolve real world errors involving Node.js versions, server environments, and package compatibility. Working through these problems improved my debugging skills and deepened my understanding of backend deployment.
