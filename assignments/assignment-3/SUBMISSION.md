# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis  

## Analysis  
For this assignment, I worked with four different CSS styles: `ai-1.css`, `ai-2.css`, `hybrid.css`, and `styles.css`. Each had a different design approach. `ai-1.css` used a clean and professional look with blue and gray colors. It was well-organized, easy to read, and worked well on different screen sizes, but it felt a little basic. `ai-2.css` had a dark theme with bright orange highlights, making it look bold and futuristic. However, the contrast made it hard to read for a long time. `styles.css` was very colorful with red, black, and yellow, but it was too loud for a personal website. `hybrid.css` combined different elements from the other styles, creating a balanced and modern look with deep red and gray. It had smooth hover effects and was easy to navigate. Overall, I saw that AI-generated designs can be helpful, but they need manual tweaks to improve readability and usability.  

## Lessons Learned  
This project showed me how important colors are in web design. Some color choices make a site look professional, while others can make it hard to read. I also learned that a website needs to be easy to use on different devices, so a responsive design is important. Another thing I noticed is that small details, like hover effects and shadows, can make a website feel more polished. While AI can generate styles quickly, I realized that human input is needed to make sure everything looks good and functions well.  

## Preferred Version  
I liked `hybrid.css` the most because it had the best mix of style and readability. The colors looked professional, and the layout was clean and easy to follow. It also had good animations that made the site feel more interactive. Compared to `ai-2.css`, which was too dark, and `styles.css`, which was too bright, `hybrid.css` felt just right. It worked well on different screen sizes and looked modern without being too flashy. That’s why I think it’s the best choice for my portfolio website.
