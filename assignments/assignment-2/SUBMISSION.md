##  HTML Personal Portfolio Website Assignment

### Description:

Designing a personal portfolio website through HTML is the primary task of this project. The main goal is to establish a well-designed webpage for presenting personal details along with projects while highlighting important content. A website homepage needs to be designed while the content must be structured through HTML elements to provide accessibility as well as responsive design features. The purpose of this assignment allows students to practice fundamental HTML concepts by using semantic elements and implementing proper structuring while organizing web content.


## Approach / What I Did:

I focused on semantic and organized coding practices to construct the HTML structure. I designed a homepage with a navigation bar, an introduction section, a projects section, and a contact form.

Layout Decisions:Â The website uses a clean and structured layout for easy navigation. It consists of sections such as "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact."

Design Choices: Prioritized readability and user experience by using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links effectively.

Elements Structure: Ensured proper use of <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> for a logical and well-formed structure.


## Code Explanation:

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    
    <!-- Metadata for SEO -->
    <meta name="description" content="Jason Arbeed's personal website">
    <meta name="keywords" content="Jason Arbeed, personal website, computer science, SFSU">
    <meta name="author" content="Jason Arbeed">

    <!-- Favicon for the website -->
    <link rel="icon" type="images/x-icon" href="images/Jimage.png">

    <!-- Link to external CSS file -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles3.css">

</head>

This HTML portfolio website is designed to be aesthetically pleasing, well-structured, and easy to use. An optimum browsing experience is ensured by the <head> element, which contains crucial metadata for SEO, responsiveness, and design. A navigation bar for easy section access follows a <header> with a title, profile picture, and introduction in the <body>. The primary content is broken up into well-organized parts that are easy to read, including projects, extracurricular activities, languages, education, and work experience. The page ends with a <footer> that includes copyright information and contact data. A professional online presence, responsiveness, and accessibility are guaranteed by the overall design.
